# Mininet-Project
Network topology simulation and performance analysis using Mininet and Python.

This project implements and analyzes multiple network topologies using Mininet. Linear, star, ring, and spine-leaf architectures were designed and evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, and fault tolerance.

# Features
- Implementation of linear, star, ring, and spine-leaf topologies
- Bandwidth measurement using iperf
- Latency analysis using ping
- Link failure simulation and recovery evaluation
- STP configuration for loop prevention
